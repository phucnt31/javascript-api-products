## Introduction

- The Product Catalog is an AJAX-based application that utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve and display a list of products from a server. When a user clicks on a product, it dynamically fetches and displays the details of that specific product without requiring a page refresh. This project showcases the integration of AJAX and the Fetch API to create an interactive product catalog.
